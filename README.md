 Hi to everyone! 


﻿﻿The start.

My name is Pato (or Duck for english speakers I guess), I play Genshin since day one and this is the first time I ('m trying to) do something that can be useful for the community.

I started this project called Genshin Gacha Calculator (GGC) today and is totally open for everyone with programming, maths, and programming and maths knowledge to give me a hand.

The thing is, theorically, this little script I made is good to go right now, but I don't have practical proofs, so there is where you, the reader and player, become a part of this!


﻿﻿How it works (almost)

Using mathematical things (I'm bad at maths), I made an script (I'm bad at programming), that can give an approximated probabilities for you to know what are the odds to get a 5-star in a banner based in your current pity, official probabilities in game, communitty calculations and more.

The script gives you the possibility to use just official info or your particular account history to make an approximation to how much possible is for you to get a 5-star in the next number of wishes you want to know.

This base calculation of probabilities is based on the already known binomial distribution method (Idk, I just learned of this thingy like 7 days ago), but apparently, a growing part of the community is testing the efficiency of this method and the results are pretty impressive, people are being able to predict 5-stars with less than 10 wishes of inexactitude and I think that is better than nothing.

So, if you, as a player, are about to pull for some good ol' powerful characters, it would be pretty helpful if first you try to use this little script to predict the results, and then leave a comment here giving me your experience.

This is just "V.1.0." so it may have bugs, errors in the code, mistakes in the formula application, so be patient, and if this works we may have something useful for all of us between our hands.


Updates.

    V.1.0:
    - Can calculate the probabilities of a 5-star item to appear in your estipulated number of pulls and customized current pity just with official info and knowledge of the probabilities (Character and Weapon banners).
    - You can introduce your last wishes history to use those probabilities for a customized result (I recommend using Paimon.moe for the oldest history of wishes possible).
    - For the costumized method you need to give a number of wishes you have done and the number of 5-stars you got on those wishes.
    - Soft pity and hard pity modifications of the 5-star chance are considerated by the calculation in the script for both, character and weapon banners.


﻿﻿Future planning.

    - The possibility to know what are the probabilities to get a multi 5-star pull in a ten pull.
    - The possibility to know which of your next ten pulls its the one with the most chances to get you a 5-star (Doubtful addition because this is usually the first ten pull after reaching soft pity).


﻿﻿Nerds: this is your moment.

As I mentioned, I'm good for nothing of the things needed for this, I main Itto, so maybe I'm not the guy, but I'm in already.

If you find an optimized way to do the coding or in the other hand, the formula application for the current or next versions of the script, leave a comment or reach me trough https://x.com/patontottv , you and your brain can be incredibly useful for everyone!

We may be cooking here, don't miss it!
